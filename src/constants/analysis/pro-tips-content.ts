      'Back knee angle': 'Back knee is bent too much. Try straightening your legs a bit more but not too much.',
      'Wrist angle': 'Pointing at the ball. You need more wrist angle at address to gain power and consistency.',
      Posture:
        'Posture is wrong. Bend at the waist with a little knee bend for best results. Let your arms hang down to address the ball.',

    Backswing: {
      'Swing plane - Steep':
        'Club shaft is too steep at ½ backswing. Butt of club should be pointing at or inside the target line.',
      'Swing plane - Shallow':
        'Club shaft is too shallow at 12 backswing. Butt of club should be pointing at or inside the target line.',
      'Stable back knee':
        'Bending your back knee too much during backswing. Keep stable for more consistent ball striking.',
      'Stable spine':
        'Spine angle is changing too much during backswing. Keep stable for more consistent ball striking.',
      'Shoulder tilt':
        'Shoulder turn is too steep. Rotate your back shoulder lower in backswing to prevent outside-in club path and too high attack angle.',

      'Swing plane - Steep':

        'Club shaft is too shallow at 12 downswing. Butt of club should be pointing at or inside the target line.',
      'Club path':
        'Club path is outside-in. This creates a fade or possibly a slice. Inside-out club path with square face will deliver straight to draw ball flight.',

      'Spine Tilt - Too Vertical Setup': 'Spine tilt is too vertical in setup. Lean away from target a bit more.',

      Takeaway:
        "Wrist is hinging too early in backswing. Start turn by rotating shoulders to initiate backswing and don't bend back elbow until the club is horizontal with ground.",
      'Lead Arm Bend':
        "Lead arm elbow is bending too much in backswing. Lead arm doesn't have to stay perfectly straight but too much bend will cause inconsistency and loss of power.",
      'Hip Sway': 'Hips are swaying in backswing. Hips should rotate without too much sway.',
      'Head Movement vertical': "Head position is rising in backswing. Don't stand up in backswing.",
      'Head Movement lateral':
        "Head position is moving toward target in backswing. Don't lean toward target in backswing.",
      'Full Backswing':
        "Club Shaft is rotating too far down in backswing. Don't drop the club shaft past horizontal with ground in backswing.",
    },
    Downswing: {
      'Club Lag Release - Too Early': `Club lag is being released too early. Hold lag angle longer. You're "casting" the club which causes loss of power and inconsistency.`,
      'Club Lag Release - Too Late':
        'Club lag is being released too late. Release lag angle sooner. Only a pro can typically strike the ball with consistency with a late lag angle release.',
      'Head Movement vertical': "Head position is rising in downswing. Don't stand up in downswing.",
      'Head Movement lateral':
        "Head position is moving toward target in downswing. Don't lean toward target in downswing.",
      'Weight Transfer':
        "As you move through downswing don't hang back on the back leg, transfer your weight to front foot.",
