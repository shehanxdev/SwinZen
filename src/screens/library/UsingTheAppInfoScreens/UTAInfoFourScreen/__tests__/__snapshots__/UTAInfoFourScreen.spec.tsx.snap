            Choose either “Down the Line” or “Face on”. Keep in mind that if you choose a video that isn’t shot in the correct perspective the system will not deliver any results. Example: If you select Down the Line, but the video you upload is Face On, there will be no data feedback on that upload.
          
Next, if you’re left-handed, use the selector to indicate that you are left-handed. If you are right-handed the toggle defaults already.
          
Select what type of club you are using.
          
4a. Auto In App Capture Method - The easiest way to upload a video because it is designed to prevent many shooting errors. Click on the big arrow to start the process.
          
4b. Manual method - If you choose to upload a video from your phone library you must make sure it is trimmed prior to uploading. It must be trimmed right before backswing and just after. Most phone camera systems have a method of editing and trimming a video. Also the fps camera setting must be on 240fps for FO and 120 or 240 fps for DTL.
